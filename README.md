# LaTeX-ID-Cards
LaTeX source to create ID cards to be printed on PVC cards loaded in a Canon "J Tray" from Brainstorm ID

This project uses csvtools from Nicola Talbot

Actually, it has been a year since I looked at the source, so I need to do that and see what else it depends on and write some more notes.  This initial upload is from the cards I am making for a woodturning club I belong to.  I will genericize it and place sample images when I commit to master.
